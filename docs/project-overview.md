# Project Overview 

## Problem Statement
- Team knowledge scattered across Slack/Jira conversations
- Manual documentation becomes stale and disconnected from code
- Institutional knowledge lost when team members leave
- No automated capture of decisions and technical discussions

## Solution Approach
**Automated Knowledge Pipeline**: Slack/Jira events → AI processing → Structured docs → GitHub PRs

### Core Components
1. **Smart Collection**: Reaction-based filtering (📝📋🔖) + keyword detection
2. **AI Processing**: Summarization, classification, key decision extraction  
3. **Code Integration**: GitHub link parsing → embedded code snippets
4. **Team Workflow**: Automated PR creation with reviewer assignment

## Primary Goals
- **Zero-effort capture**: Integrate with existing workflows
- **Living documentation**: Sync with codebase changes  
- **AI-enhanced insights**: Extract decisions, action items, context
- **Team collaboration**: Review/approval workflows

## Success Metrics
- Reduce "where did we decide this?" questions
- Maintain code-documentation synchronization  
- Preserve institutional knowledge automatically
- Improve new team member onboarding speed

## Current Status
✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Core pipeline + basic code tracking  
🚧 **Phase 2 Next**: Smart change detection + GitHub webhooks  

## Target Audience
Engineering teams (5-50 people) needing automated knowledge management with code integration.
